# OBS-Plugin
Creator Coin OBS Plugin - Made w/ &lt;3 by the Rally Community.

## How it works

The rally OBS plugin, is a native plugin developed in C & QT powered by CEF ([Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/README.md)), so it's fully compatible with the OBS Studio. 

This allows the plugin alerts to be fully customizable using CSS and also allows the activity feed to display a customizable stream of alerts from a node.js server listening to hooks from the Rally API.
